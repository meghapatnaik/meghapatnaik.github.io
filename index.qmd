::: {#hero-heading}

Welcome! 

I am a Assistant Professor (tenure track) at the Department of Economics and Finance, LUISS Guido Carli in Rome, and a research affiliate at CEPR.

My research interests include management, entrepreneurship, machine learning and open source big data techniques. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University in 2017.
