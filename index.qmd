Welcome! 

I am an Assistant Professor (tenure track) at the Department of Economics and Finance, LUISS Guido Carli in Rome, and a research affiliate at CEPR and at CESifo. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University. Here is my [CV](misc/info/CV_patnaik.pdf).

I am Visiting Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at Stanford University during Spring and Summer quarters 2024-2025.
