::: {#hero-heading}

Welcome! 

I am an Assistant Professor (tenure track) at the Department of Economics and Finance, LUISS Guido Carli in Rome, and a research affiliate at CEPR. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University in 2017. Here is my [CV](misc/info/CV_patnaik.pdf).


My research interests include management, entrepreneurship, machine learning and open source big data techniques. I am cofounder of [Leap Insights](https://leap-insights.org/) and part of the [Network of Women in Data Science & Social Science](https://sites.google.com/view/windsnetwork).
